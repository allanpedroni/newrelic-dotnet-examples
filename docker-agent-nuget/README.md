# New Relic .NET Agent Samples - Docker - Agent via NuGet

This folder contains a set of sample applications that run in Docker containers for various Linux distros. These samples
demonstrate how to configure the Docker environment to run an application that has added the `NewRelic.Agent` [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NewRelic.Agent)
to the application. This is the recommended method of using the .NET Agent from a .NET application.

Refer to the README for each of the samples for further details and instructions.
